# Assignment 1 - Agent Based Model

BACKGROUND

This assignment is designed to intoduce the Python programming language by building a model through various weeks of development and increasing complexity. The idea is that there is a user interface created with TKinter, an imported environment (environment.csv) which is displayed using matplotlib and then animated showing the agents (a simple way to imagine them is sheep) moveing and eating/nibbling their way across the environment. 

The program is run through command prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac). It should be noted this program has been developed and tested on a Mac through terminal, hence instructions will primarily focus on Mac use but with additional details on Windows use, although there may be some unexpected differences.
